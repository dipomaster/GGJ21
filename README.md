Global Game Jam '21

Check in the back is a visual novel where you help convention patrons find their lost belongings.

As the unlucky 20-something manning the lost-and-found office of a large fan convention, help a handful of quirky characters find their stuff! 

If you can supply friendly conversation and quick service, maybe you'll get hired permanently!

Made for Global Game Jam 2021, the theme was "Lost-and-Found".
